## Introduction

The tutorials under the AI Engine Development help you learn how to target, develop, and deploy advanced algorithms using a Versal AI Engine array in conjunction with PL IP/kernels and software applications running on the embedded processors. In order to successfully deploy AI Engine applications in hardware, you need to be aware of the Vitis and AI Engine tools and flows.

- The AI Engine Development <a href="./Feature_Tutorials/">**Feature Tutorials**</a> highlight specific features and flows that help develop AI Engine applications.

- The AI Engine Development <a href="./Design_Tutorials/">**Design Tutorials**</a> showcase the two major phases of AI Engine application development: architecting the application and developing the kernels. Both these phases are demonstrated in these tutorials.
